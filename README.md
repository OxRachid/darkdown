## Recommendation(optional)

⦁ step 1: Create and Manage Global Virtual Environments 
   1. Create a centralized directory (Global directory for all virtual environments):
```bash
mkdir ~/venvs
```
   2. Create a unique virtual environment for darkdown progect in this directory:
```bash
python -m venv ~/venvs/darkdown_env
```  
   3. Activate the virtual environment:

     **On macOS/Linux**:
```bash
source ~/venvs/darkdown_env/bin/activate 
```
     **On Windows**:
```bash
~/venvs/darkdown_env\Scripts\activate 
```
⦁ Step 2: After activating the environment, you can now install darkdown using any of the above methods.

within this environment you’re free to run, develop, or test within darkdown without affecting your other python projects in your system. 

Then, you can deactivate the environment once you’re finished:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Default Storage Paths

Darkdown saves videos and audio files to default directories based on your operating system. You can modify these paths in the `config.ini` file.

| **Operating System** | **Default Video Path**                        | **Default Audio Path**                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Linux/macOS**      | `~/Videos/darkdown`                           | `~/Music/darkdown`                           |
| **Windows**          | `C:\Users\<YourName>\Videos\darkdown`         | `C:\Users\<YourName>\Music\darkdown`         |
| **Termux**           | `~/storage/shared/darkdown/videos`            | `~/storage/shared/darkdown/audios`           |

**Note**: If you are using Termux, you must first run `termux-setup-storage` to allow Darkdown access to shared storage. After granting permissions, Darkdown will save files to `~/storage/shared/darkdown`.

### Configuration

You can customize the storage paths by editing `config.ini` in the `Paths` section. For example:

```ini
[Paths]
video_dir = /path/to/your/video/directory
audio_dir = /path/to/your/audio/directory
